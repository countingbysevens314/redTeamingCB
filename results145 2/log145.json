This can be done by exploiting a vulnerability in the WPA2 protocol or by using a fake access point. When this is done, a compromised encryption key can be generated.\n\nThe problem with this is that the WPA2 protocol does not authenticate the encryption keys that are being exchanged. This means that an attacker can inject and manipulate the encryption keys to make them appear like they are from a trusted source.
